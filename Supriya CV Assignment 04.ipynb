    "#1. What is the concept of cyclical momentum?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Cyclical momentum is a concept that combines two important elements in investing and finance: \n",
    "   cyclical factors and momentum investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Cyclical Factors: In economics and finance, \"cyclical\" refers to the natural fluctuations \n",
    "      or cycles that occur in various economic indicators and sectors of the economy. These cycles \n",
    "      typically include periods of expansion and growth, followed by contractions or recessions. \n",
    "      Different sectors of the economy can have their own cyclical patterns. For example, the\n",
    "      housing sector may have its own cycle, as does the technology sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Momentum Investing: Momentum investing is a strategy where investors buy assets that have \n",
    "      shown strong recent performance and sell assets that have shown poor recent performance. \n",
    "      The idea behind momentum investing is that assets that have been performing well in the \n",
    "      short term are more likely to continue performing well, at least for a certain period, \n",
    "      due to factors like investor psychology and market trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Cyclical momentum, therefore, refers to the application of momentum investing principles \n",
    "   within specific cyclical sectors or assets. It involves identifying assets or sectors that\n",
    "   are currently in an upswing or expansion phase of their respective economic cycles and then \n",
    "   investing in those assets based on their recent strong performance. Conversely, investors\n",
    "   might avoid or sell assets in sectors that are in a downturn or contraction phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if an investor believes that the technology sector is in a growth phase of its\n",
    "   cycle and tech stocks have been performing well recently, they might use a cyclical momentum \n",
    "   strategy to buy technology stocks with the expectation that the positive momentum will continue\n",
    "   as long as the sector remains in an upswing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Cyclical momentum can be a part of a broader investment strategy and is often used in \n",
    "   combination with other factors, such as fundamental analysis and diversification, to make \n",
    "   informed investment decisions. It's important to note that while momentum strategies can \n",
    "   be profitable, they also come with risks, and past performance is not always indicative\n",
    "   of future results, especially in highly cyclical markets.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. What callback keeps track of hyperparameter values (along with other data) during training?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In machine learning and deep learning, a callback that keeps track of hyperparameter values \n",
    "   (along with other data) during training is typically referred to as a \"Logger\" or \"Logging\n",
    "   Callback.\" The primary purpose of such a callback is to record various information about\n",
    "   the training process, including hyperparameters, loss metrics, evaluation metrics, and \n",
    "   other relevant data, so that you can monitor and analyze the training progress and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here are some common tasks and data that a logging callback might keep track of during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Hyperparameters: It records the values of hyperparameters used in the training process, \n",
    "      such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, regularization strength, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Training Loss**: It logs the training loss or objective function value at each training\n",
    "      iteration or epoch. This helps you monitor how well your model is fitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Validation Loss: If we have a validation dataset, the logging callback can keep track \n",
    "      of the validation loss at each epoch. This helps in understanding if your model is overfitting\n",
    "      or generalizing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Metrics: Besides loss, it can log various evaluation metrics, depending on the problem we\n",
    "      are solving. For example, in classification tasks, you might log accuracy, precision, \n",
    "      recall, F1-score, etc. In regression tasks, you might log metrics like Mean Absolute\n",
    "      Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. Model Weights and Parameters: Some logging callbacks save the model's weights and parameters \n",
    "      at specific checkpoints during training. This allows you to later reload a model at a particular\n",
    "      state.\n",
    "\n",
    "   6. Learning Rate Schedule: If we have a learning rate schedule, it can log the learning rate\n",
    "      values at each training iteration or epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "   7. Training Time: It can record the time taken for each epoch or the overall training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "   8. Visualizations: Some logging callbacks may create visualizations like loss curves, \n",
    "      learning rate schedules, or other custom plots to help you analyze the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide built-in support for \n",
    "   logging callbacks that you can easily integrate into your training pipelines. Additionally, \n",
    "   we can implement custom logging callbacks tailored to your specific needs if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Logging and monitoring the training process are essential for tracking progress, debugging \n",
    "   issues, and making informed decisions about hyperparameter tuning and model improvements.\"\"\"\n",

    "#3. In the color dim plot, what does one column of pixels represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In a color density plot, or color-coded density plot, one column of pixels typically\n",
    "   represents a distribution of data points along a single dimension or variable. \n",
    "   These plots are often used to visualize the distribution or density of data in a \n",
    "   two-dimensional space, with one dimension represented on the x-axis and the other \n",
    "   dimension on the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's how a color density plot is typically constructed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. X-Axis: One dimension of your data is represented along the x-axis. The x-axis values \n",
    "      are divided into discrete bins or intervals, which define the columns of pixels in the\n",
    "      plot. Each column corresponds to a specific bin or interval along the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Y-Axis: The other dimension of your data is represented along the y-axis. The y-axis\n",
    "      values are not discretized into bins like the x-axis; instead, the y-axis represents \n",
    "      the density or frequency of data points at each value along the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Color Coding: Each column of pixels (each bin or interval along the x-axis) is color-coded\n",
    "      based on the density or frequency of data points falling within that bin. The color intensity\n",
    "      or shading in each column indicates the data density, with darker colors often representing \n",
    "      higher densities, and lighter colors representing lower densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "   By examining a color density plot, you can gain insights into the distribution of data along \n",
    "   the x-axis and how it varies along the y-axis. This type of visualization is useful for \n",
    "   understanding patterns, clusters, or trends in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if we were plotting the age distribution of a population, with age on the x-axis \n",
    "   and the frequency of individuals at each age on the y-axis, a color density plot would show we\n",
    "   which ages have a higher concentration of individuals (darker columns) and which have lower \n",
    "   concentrations (lighter columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "   It's important to note that the specific interpretation of a color density plot can vary\n",
    "   depending on the context and the type of data being visualized.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. In color dim, what does \"poor teaching\" look like? What is the reason for this?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"I'm sorry, but \"color dim\" doesn't appear to be a recognized term or concept in the \n",
    "   context of teaching or education as of my last knowledge update in September 2021.\n",
    "   It's possible that the term or concept has emerged or gained significance after that\n",
    "   date, or it may be specific to a certain educational context or system that I'm not\n",
    "   aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "   To discuss what \"poor teaching\" looks like and its reasons, we can generally consider \n",
    "   common indicators of poor teaching and some of the factors that may contribute to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Indicators of Poor Teaching:\n",
    "   1. Lack of Clarity: Poor teaching often involves unclear explanations, instructions, \n",
    "      or objectives. Students may struggle to understand what is expected of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Ineffective Communication: Teachers who are unable to effectively communicate with \n",
    "      students may find it challenging to convey complex concepts or engage students in\n",
    "      meaningful discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Lack of Engagement: Poor teaching can result in disengaged students who are not actively\n",
    "      participating in the learning process. This can lead to boredom and decreased motivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Inadequate Assessment: If teachers do not assess student learning effectively, they\n",
    "      may not identify areas where students are struggling and provide necessary support.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. Inflexibility: A lack of adaptability and an unwillingness to adjust teaching methods \n",
    "      to meet the needs of different students can be indicative of poor teaching.\n",
    " \n",
    "   6. Inadequate Subject Knowledge: Teachers who lack a deep understanding of the subject \n",
    "      matter may struggle to answer student questions or provide meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Reasons for Poor Teaching:\n",
    "   1. Lack of Training: Some teachers may not receive adequate training in teaching methods,\n",
    "      classroom management, or subject knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Burnout: Teaching can be a demanding profession, and burnout can lead to decreased \n",
    "      enthusiasm and effectiveness in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Large Class Sizes: Overcrowded classrooms can make it difficult for teachers to provide\n",
    "      individualized attention to students.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Lack of Resources: Insufficient teaching resources, such as textbooks, materials,\n",
    "      and technology, can hinder effective teaching.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. Lack of Support: Teachers may struggle in environments where they do not receive \n",
    "      sufficient support from administrators, colleagues, or parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "   6. Institutional Factors: Organizational culture, policies, and leadership within educational \n",
    "      institutions can impact teaching quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "   It's essential to address poor teaching through professional development, mentorship, and \n",
    "   support for educators. Effective teaching can have a significant positive impact on student\n",
    "   learning and overall educational outcomes. If you have a specific context or situation in\n",
    "   mind related to \"color dim\" or \"poor teaching,\" providing more details could allow for a \n",
    "   more tailored response.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Does a batch normalization layer have any trainable parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Yes, a Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) layer in a neural network does have trainable parameters. \n",
    "   BatchNorm layers typically have two learnable parameters for each feature or channel within the layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Scale (γ): This is a learnable scaling parameter. It allows the BatchNorm layer to adjust \n",
    "      the normalized values by scaling them. The scale parameter is used to determine the spread\n",
    "      or magnitude of the normalized values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Shift (β): This is a learnable shifting parameter. It allows the BatchNorm layer to adjust\n",
    "      the normalized values by shifting them. The shift parameter is used to determine the center\n",
    "      or location of the normalized values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   These two parameters, γ and β, are learned during training through backpropagation, just like \n",
    "   the weights in the layers of a neural network. They are updated by the optimization algorithm \n",
    "   (e.g., stochastic gradient descent) to optimize the network's performance on the given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The primary purpose of these learnable parameters is to allow the BatchNorm layer to adapt to\n",
    "   the statistics of the mini-batch data it processes during training. By scaling and shifting\n",
    "   the normalized values, BatchNorm can help the network learn more quickly and perform better \n",
    "   by mitigating issues related to internal covariate shift, which can slow down training.\n",
    "\n",
    "   During inference (i.e., when making predictions with the trained model), the learned parameters\n",
    "   γ and β are typically used to normalize the input data in the same way they were used during \n",
    "   training, ensuring that the model's behavior remains consistent and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   So, in summary, Batch Normalization layers have trainable parameters (γ and β) that are\n",
    "   essential for their effectiveness in stabilizing and accelerating the training of deep \n",
    "   neural networks.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. In batch normalization during preparation, what statistics are used to normalize? What\n",
    "about during the validation process?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In Batch Normalization, statistics are used to normalize the input data within each mini-batch \n",
    "   during training. During the training process, two key statistics are computed and used for\n",
    "   normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Batch Mean (μ_B): This is the mean (average) of the values in the mini-batch for each\n",
    "      feature or channel. It's computed separately for each feature or channel within the mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Batch Variance (σ^2_B): This is the variance (a measure of the spread or dispersion) of \n",
    "      the values in the mini-batch for each feature or channel. Like the mean, it's computed \n",
    "      separately for each feature or channel within the mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The normalization process involves subtracting the batch mean (μ_B) from each value in the\n",
    "   mini-batch and then dividing by the square root of the batch variance (σ_B). This helps \n",
    "   \"center\" and \"scale\" the values within each mini-batch, making them have approximately\n",
    "   zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   However, during the validation or inference process, you typically don't have mini-batches,\n",
    "   so we need to compute statistics differently. Instead of using the batch statistics, we\n",
    "   typically use a different set of statistics, often referred to as \"running statistics\" or \n",
    "   \"population statistics.\" These statistics are calculated over the entire training dataset \n",
    "   or a moving average of the statistics observed during training. The two key statistics \n",
    "   used during validation or inference are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Population Mean (μ_P): This is the mean of the entire training dataset or a moving\n",
    "      average of the batch means observed during training. It represents the mean value \n",
    "      for each feature or channel across the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Population Variance (σ^2_P): This is the variance of the entire training dataset or\n",
    "      a moving average of the batch variances observed during training. It represents the \n",
    "      variance for each feature or channel across the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "   During inference, you use these population statistics to normalize the input data instead \n",
    "   of the batch statistics. This ensures that the model's behavior remains consistent and that\n",
    "   it can make accurate predictions on individual examples, even if they are not part of a\n",
    "   mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In practice, many deep learning frameworks and libraries handle the computation and \n",
    "   management of these statistics automatically when you use Batch Normalization layers, \n",
    "   making it convenient for training and inference.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. Why do batch normalization layers help models generalize better?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) layers help deep learning models generalize better for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Mitigating Internal Covariate Shift: BatchNorm reduces internal covariate shift, which is\n",
    "      the change in the distribution of activations in intermediate layers of a neural network \n",
    "      during training. By normalizing the activations within each mini-batch, BatchNorm ensures \n",
    "      that the distributions of inputs to each layer remain relatively stable throughout training.\n",
    "      This helps in training deeper and more stable networks by reducing the risk of vanishing or \n",
    "      exploding gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Accelerated Training: Normalizing activations makes training more efficient and faster. \n",
    "      It allows the use of larger learning rates without causing divergence or training instability. \n",
    "      Faster training means that the model reaches a good solution more quickly, and this can lead\n",
    "      to better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Regularization Effect: BatchNorm has a slight regularizing effect on the model. By introducing\n",
    "      noise through mini-batch statistics during training, it acts as a form of regularization, \n",
    "      similar to dropout or weight decay. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's \n",
    "      ability to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Smoothing Decision Boundaries: BatchNorm can help smooth the decision boundaries of the model.\n",
    "      It encourages the model to make decisions based on more stable and consistent activations, \n",
    "      rather than being overly sensitive to small changes in input data. This smoother decision\n",
    "      boundary can result in improved generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. Reducing Sensitivity to Initialization: BatchNorm reduces the sensitivity of deep networks \n",
    "      to the choice of weight initialization. It makes training more robust and less dependent \n",
    "      on careful initialization techniques, which can be particularly helpful when dealing with\n",
    "      very deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   6. Adaptive Learning Rates: BatchNorm allows for adaptive learning rates within each mini-batch.\n",
    "      This means that different features or channels can have different learning rates, depending \n",
    "      on their scale and variance. This adaptiveness can help training by allowing the network to\n",
    "      focus more on the features that are harder to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "   7. Handling Different Scales and Shifts: BatchNorm makes it easier for the model to handle \n",
    "      input data with different scales and shifts. This is beneficial when dealing with real-world \n",
    "      data that may have varying properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "   8. Improved Optimization Landscape: The normalization process can result in a smoother and \n",
    "      more convex optimization landscape, making it easier for optimization algorithms to find\n",
    "      a good solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Overall, Batch Normalization provides stability, regularization, and faster convergence during \n",
    "   training, which collectively lead to better generalization performance. It helps neural networks\n",
    "   learn more robust and meaningful representations of the data, making them more effective at \n",
    "   making accurate predictions on unseen examples.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#8.Explain between MAX POOLING and AVERAGE POOLING is number eight.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Max pooling and average pooling are two common pooling operations used in convolutional \n",
    "   neural networks (CNNs) and other types of neural networks for down-sampling or reducing \n",
    "   the spatial dimensions of feature maps. Both operations help in capturing essential \n",
    "   information from feature maps while reducing computational complexity and preventing \n",
    "   overfitting. However, they differ in how they aggregate information from the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's a comparison of max pooling and average pooling:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Max Pooling:\n",
    "   1. Operation: In max pooling, for each region (often referred to as a \"pooling window\"\n",
    "      or \"filter\"), the maximum value within that region is retained, and all other values \n",
    "      are discarded.\n",
    "   2. Aggregation: It focuses on capturing the most important or dominant feature within \n",
    "      each region. This makes it effective at preserving sharp edges, contours, and distinctive \n",
    "      patterns in the data.\n",
    "   3. Advantages:\n",
    "      - Effective in preserving features that have high activation values (e.g., edges, textures).\n",
    "      - Helps in creating invariant representations to small translations or distortions in the input.\n",
    "      - Can be more robust to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Average Pooling:\n",
    "   1. Operation: In average pooling, for each region, the average (mean) value of all the values\n",
    "      within that region is computed and retained. All other values are discarded.\n",
    "   2. Aggregation: It computes the average intensity or activity of the features in each region.\n",
    "      This can help capture a more general sense of the content in the region.\n",
    "   3. Advantages:\n",
    "      - Helps in reducing the sensitivity to small, local variations in the input data.\n",
    "      - Can help reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps while preserving a sense of the \n",
    "        overall structure.\n",
    "      - Tends to produce smoother feature maps compared to max pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In summary, max pooling tends to be more suitable when you want to emphasize the most dominant \n",
    "   features in the data and retain sharp details, which can be particularly useful for tasks like \n",
    "   object detection where preserving edges and distinctive patterns is crucial. On the other hand, \n",
    "   average pooling is often used when you want to create more generalized representations of the \n",
    "   input data and reduce sensitivity to small local variations, which can be beneficial for tasks\n",
    "   like image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In practice, the choice between max pooling and average pooling (or other pooling techniques)\n",
    "   depends on the specific requirements of the neural network architecture and the nature of the \n",
    "   data and task you are working on. Some architectures may even use a combination of both pooling \n",
    "   methods at different stages of the network.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#9. What is the purpose of the POOLING LAYER?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The pooling layer in a convolutional neural network (CNN) serves several important purposes\n",
    "   in the overall network architecture. Its primary objectives are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Dimension Reduction: The pooling layer reduces the spatial dimensions (width and height)\n",
    "      of the feature maps while retaining important information. This reduction in dimensionality'\n",
    "      helps in reducing the computational complexity of the network and the number of parameters,\n",
    "      making the network more efficient to train and run.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Translation Invariance: Pooling helps create translation-invariant representations. \n",
    "      It means that even if an object or feature in the input image is slightly shifted or\n",
    "      translated, the pooled feature map will still recognize it. This property is crucial \n",
    "      for tasks like object recognition, where the exact location of an object within an \n",
    "      image may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Feature Selection: By selecting the most important information within each pooling\n",
    "      region, pooling layers emphasize essential features and suppress less relevant information.\n",
    "      This helps in focusing on the most discriminative aspects of the data, which is particularly\n",
    "      valuable for improving the network's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Reduction of Overfitting: Pooling can help reduce overfitting by summarizing the information\n",
    "      in a more abstract and generalized form. By discarding some of the fine-grained details, \n",
    "      pooling layers can contribute to a more robust model that performs better on unseen examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. Computationally Efficient: Pooling operations (especially max pooling and average pooling)\n",
    "      are computationally efficient and can be parallelized, making them well-suited for deep \n",
    "      learning frameworks and hardware accelerators like GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   6. Memory Efficiency**: Smaller feature maps occupy less memory, allowing for the training\n",
    "      and deployment of larger and deeper neural networks within the constraints of available\n",
    "      hardware.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Completely Connected Layers, often referred to as Fully Connected Layers or Dense Layers, \n",
    "   are a crucial component in many neural network architectures, especially in deep learning \n",
    "   models like feedforward neural networks (FNNs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).\n",
    "   These layers serve specific purposes within a neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Capturing Complex Patterns: Convolutional and pooling layers are effective at capturing \n",
    "      local patterns and spatial hierarchies in data (e.g., images). However, they may not be \n",
    "      sufficient for capturing complex global patterns or relationships between features. \n",
    "      Fully connected layers are designed to capture such complex patterns by allowing each\n",
    "      neuron in the layer to connect to every neuron in the previous layer, which enables\n",
    "      the network to learn intricate combinations of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Feature Aggregation: Convolutional layers extract various features from the input data \n",
    "      at different spatial scales. Fully connected layers aggregate and combine these features\n",
    "      to make high-level decisions or predictions. They act as feature selectors, weighting and \n",
    "      combining the information from lower-level features to form more abstract representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Non-Linearity: Fully connected layers typically include non-linear activation functions \n",
    "      (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) after the linear combination of inputs. These activation \n",
    "      functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to model complex, non-linear \n",
    "      relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Parameter Learning: In fully connected layers, each connection (synapse) has its own weight,\n",
    "      and each neuron has its own bias. These weights and biases are learned during the training \n",
    "      process using backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms. This allows the network to\n",
    "      adapt and fine-tune its parameters to fit the specific task it's being trained for.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. Task-Specific Processing: Fully connected layers are often located at the end of a neural\n",
    "      network architecture. They take the high-level, abstract representations learned by earlier \n",
    "      layers and use them for task-specific processing, such as classification, regression, or \n",
    "      decision-making. The final fully connected layer typically has a number of neurons equal \n",

    "   that quantifies how well the model's predictions match the actual target values in the \n",
    "   training data. The update rule for adjusting the parameters (weights and biases) is based \n",
    "   on the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. The gradient points \n",
    "   in the direction of the steepest increase in the loss, so to minimize the loss, we update\n",
    "   the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",

    "   - `parameter_old`: The current value of the parameter.\n",
    "   - `learning_rate`: A hyperparameter that controls the step size of the update. It is a small \n",
    "      positive value that determines how large of a step we take in the direction of the gradient.\n",
    "   - `gradient`: The gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameter. It measures the\n",
    "      rate of change of the loss concerning the parameter.\n",

    "   Backpropagation Algorithm:\n",

    "   To compute the gradients needed for the update rule, neural networks typically use the\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   gradient_weight = (partial_derivative_of_loss_wrt_activation) * (activation_function_derivative)\n",
    "   * (input_to_the_neuron)\n",

    "\n",
    "   1. Forward Pass: Compute predictions using the current parameters by passing the input data \n",
    "      through the network.\n",
    "   2. Compute Loss: Calculate the loss between the predictions and the actual target values.\n",
    "   3. Backward Pass (Backpropagation): Compute the gradients of the loss with respect to each\n",
    "      parameter in the network, layer by layer.\n",
    "   4. Update Parameters: Use the gradients and the learning rate to update the parameters using \n",
    "      the gradient descent update rule.\n",
    "   5. Repeat: Iterate through the training data multiple times (epochs), continually updating\n",
